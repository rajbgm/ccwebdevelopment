935,"Answering Questions Surrounding Custom, Adaptable, and Patient-Matched Medical Devices","Technological advancements in manufacturing make it possible for manufacturers to commercially produce <a href=""https://clinchoice.com/custom-made-medical-devices-eu-requirements/"">personalized custom medical devices (CMD)</a> much faster. The advancements, when coupled with regulatory changes, can be confusing. That’s why we’ve created this brief review to help clarify the most critical points within recent European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) updates.

MDR Article 2(3) defines CMDs as any device specifically made per a prescription lawfully provided by a qualified professional, with specific design characteristics to address that particular patient’s condition or needs. Mass-produced devices adapted to meet the requirements of any professional user and mass-produced devices per the written prescription or an authorized person are not considered CMDS.

When it comes to considerations and applications of MDR to custom medical devices, manufacturers should ascertain and apply appropriate regulatory requirements and implement a quality management system commensurate to the type and risk of the device being supplied. Our review further explores post-market surveillance obligations and reports, UDI requirements, and adjacent or intermediary products.

Implementing the new MDR requirements and understanding considerations outlined in the MCDG documents for manufacturers of personalized medical devices is complex and may require additional resources and expertise to manage a product through its lifecycle. The article outlines areas that need focus for registration and continuous compliance:
<ul style=""margin-left: 1.5em;"">
 	<li>Regulatory intelligence</li>
 	<li>Engagement with health authorities and official agencies on behalf of clients in the EU and abroad</li>

How rare are rare diseases? The Orphan Drug Act defines a rare disease as a disease or condition that affects less than 200,000 people in the United States.<!--more--> Therefore, the odds of being affected by one individual rare disease is relatively low. However, when looking at all rare diseases under one umbrella, the odds drastically increase. Ten percent of Americans are affected by <em>any</em> rare disease. While this may seem like a strikingly high percentage, perhaps this next statistic is even more alarming: Ninety-five percent of known rare diseases do not have a drug approved for treatment. The need to develop novel drugs and therapies to treat those suffering from rare diseases is more important than ever.

There are currently over 500 rare disease drugs in clinical development. The below chart shows a breakdown of these rare disease drugs by therapeutic area:

The demand for rare disease prescriptions has steadily increased since 2016 and is expected to continue rising for years.

There are many reasons to be optimistic about the future of rare disease drug development. Opportunities for better and faster development include the 1983 Orphan Drug Act, FDA expedited programs for serious conditions and advocacy groups.

Due in part to these opportunities, there have been many noteworthy advances in rare disease drug development. Advancements include developing the first treatments of cystic fibrosis, significant advances in targeted therapies for many forms of blood cancer, and developing the first treatments for batten disease, a rare pediatric condition.
<h2>ClinChoice Contribution to Rare Disease Drug Development</h2>
ClinChoice has provided statistics and programming services for a multitude of rare disease drugs and is familiar with the methodologies aiming to lessen the complications caused by unclear natural history and small sample size. We routinely provide tests of totality of evidence combining multiple endpoints. Global tests such as Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, O’Brien Test, and Composite Subject-Level Response analyses supplement the separate analyses for individual endpoints. The evidence of treatment effect is explored by both quantification and qualification of endpoint measures. Different simulations compare methods for the parameter of interest based on bias, mean square error, Type 1 error, and statistical power.
<h2>Rare Disease Day</h2>
Each year, ClinChoice recognizes Rare Disease Day to raise awareness. In 2022, Rare Disease Day is on February 28<sup>th</sup>.

Our mission at ClinChoice is to contribute to a healthier and safer world by accelerating the development and commercialization of innovative drugs and devices. Let’s work together to make the world a better place by ending suffering for rare disease patients.

1248,"Leveraging Technology Effectively in Clinical Research","Clinical research is a rapidly evolving field. As technologies improve and advanced capabilities become accessible, new tools, methodologies, and processes also emerge. Depending on the area of research, size, target demographics, and other factors, these new technologies can help improve efficiency, accuracy, speed, and the quality of data gathered and analyzed.

A key element of any CRO’s overall strategy should be to explore the leading edge of what’s possible in clinical research. Today’s tech-driven solutions help monitor and leverage real-world evidence (RWE) and real-world data (RWD) to provide the clearest and most accurate courses to evaluate patient treatments and guide the development of new medical interventions and therapies. These tools allow a CRO to quickly and easily receive patient consent for data sharing and gathering, and help parse, filter, and manage data effectively as it’s imported from a given trial.

In this blog, we’re exploring the <strong>key elements of leveraging technology effectively in clinical research</strong>.

<strong>A CRO that Explores the Best Tech Options for You</strong>
To put it simply, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to clinical research technology. Experienced CROs start with a big-picture strategy that will meet your specific needs. Then, hone in on determining the exact technologies and systems to optimize your research and enable success. As the client, you shouldn’t need to make any costly technology overhauls or train staff to learn complex new technologies and software.

In a managed service model, your CRO will recommend and implement the technologies that suit the exact specifications and budget of the trial. You should also receive a full assessment of a project’s budget, scope, and schedule and makes recommendations accordingly. The most trusted CROs are committed to helping clients make the most of their time and money and make a concerted effort to recommend only those solutions that are truly worth your investment. The point is to not only help you achieve your goals but to do so cost-effectively.

Leading CROs offer expert assistance from day one to answer questions and share their knowledge whenever you need it. From application management to validation to business accelerator development, you get end-to-end support for the solutions and best practices that empower you to achieve more, sooner.

<strong>Sifting Through Tech Trends in Clinical Research</strong>
Just about every new technology promises to “revolutionize the industry.” With so many options to sift through, pursuing the most appropriate ones can be costly and frequently still leads only to insufficient and suboptimal solutions. It’s important to note that an honest, reputable CRO will never push the newest, most expensive technologies on you in every situation. The most effective CROs work to understand new and emerging technologies so they can always recommend what is best for the client, based wholly on a complete understanding of their objectives, needs, and limitations.

<strong>Common Tools Used in Clinical Operations Engagements</strong>
At the heights of the COVID-19 pandemic, the clinical research industry rapidly pivoted toward decentralized and virtual or siteless trials to try and get back on track after so many delays. Fortunately, we have the technology to empower new methodologies, and these trials bear many benefits. Patients no longer need to travel, eliminating a significant burden for many, and patient consent and opt-in processes have been completely streamlined and simplified. Siteless trials also minimize health risks for all patients involved, many of whom have conditions that heighten their vulnerability to disease.

Some of the prominent technologies leveraged today include:

• Clinical Trial Training Platforms (eLearning)
Virtual clinical trials lack onsite training management, but the flexibility of on-demand learning with a clinical trial training platform enables easily scalable training programs that help reduce risk.

• Electronic Data Capture (EDC)
EDC platforms enable patients to enter information remotely and secure all participant information and trial data in one place.

• Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS)
A CTMS is a project management tool tailored to individual clinical operations programs. As the need for virtual and decentralized clinical trial management has exploded, a CTMS is invaluable for managing contacts, documents, calendars, monitoring, site activities, payments, workflows, and much more in a centralized platform.

• Electronic Trial Master File (eTMF)
The eTMF houses all vital documentation about your clinical trial and provides a clear regulatory overview.

• eConsent
eConsent solutions offer simple and compliant electronic signature processes with support for media like images, videos, infographics, and more to aid user comprehension.

• Electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment (eCOA and ePRO)
eCOAs enable clinicians, patients, and site staff to easily input outcomes into the digital system. An ePRO is one type of eCOA that provides outcomes entry data for multiple stakeholders, while ePRO is only for patients.

• Supply Management
Supply management platforms help with the movement, tracking, and monitoring of all trial materials administered to and received from patients. It manages supply inventory, reordering, and related data management.

• Patient Management Software
Various software platforms to help simplify, streamline, and optimize patient management throughout clinical trials include:
o Electronic Health Record Mining
o Televisit Platforms
o Patient Engagement
o Virtual Site Monitoring

<strong>Getting Started with the Right CRO</strong>
There are still a lot of challenges as the industry continues to deploy decentralized, hybrid, and entirely virtual clinical trials. Technology has become the cornerstone for most of our research today, and these clinical trial technology solutions make the process much easier, but the biggest decision you’ll have to make is who you trust as your CRO.

There’s a lot to consider when it comes to choosing the right CRO, but making the right choice doesn’t have to be intimidating. With decades of proven quality and results in 30+ therapeutic areas, ClinChoice helps large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with a flexible approach and dedicated teams who enable rapid startups and fast timelines.

1272,"Regulatory Submission of Generic Drugs in Canada – Best Practices","The development of a generic drug is very different from that of an innovative drug with a novel chemical composition. It must be sufficiently comparable to the latter to determine whether a generic drug is therapeutically equivalent to an innovator product. To be market-effective, drug companies must develop generic drugs that achieve the same level of therapeutic safety, efficacy, and functionality as branded drugs1.
The Canadian Health Authority (Health Canada) seeks to increase the availability of generic drugs to make them more affordable, safe, and accessible. Currently, generic drugs receive approvals 15 to 20 times more often than new drugs. Health Canada’s Health Products and Food Branch (HPFB) regulates, evaluates, and monitors the safety, efficacy, and quality therapeutic and diagnostic products available to the public. Several guidelines explain to what extent data must be provided before Health Canada approves a drug. As a result, for a generic drug to be approved and introduced on the market, a submission must be made to the HPFB. Upon a positive review by the HPFB, the generic drug is granted a Notice of Compliance (NOC) and a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A crucial component of regulatory approval of the generic drug is the Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) process2.

Abbreviated New Drugs Submission: The Pathway to Generic Drug Approval
A sponsor must submit an ANDS if a generic version of a previously approved drug is deemed ‘pharmacologically equivalent’ or ‘bioequivalent’ to the Canadian Reference Product (CRP). The following criteria must be met in accordance with the FDA Regulations (FDR) to file an ANDS:
• The generic drug is bioequivalent or pharmaceutically equivalent to the Canadian Reference Product (CRP)
• The generic drug has the same medicinal ingredients, in the same amount, with the same dosage form as the CRP
• The generic drug is administered by the same route as that of CRP2
There may be differences in non-medicinal ingredients (excipients) between generic drugs and CRPs. However, the company must demonstrate that these differences do not affect the generic drug's safety, efficacy, or quality.
Although these are the main points to remember, there are also many other aspects to consider for the successful approval of an ANDS.

Generic Drug Submission in Canada: Common Pitfalls to Avoid
A generic drug submission, or ANDS, goes through the same review process as a brand-name drug submission. The following points should be considered when filling out the ANDS to avoid common mistakes.
• Suitable studies should be conducted to design and test a generic drug.
• A generic drug must meet all national and international patent and data protection requirements. ANDS cannot be submitted before a patent expires or a manufacturer challenges it2.
• The generic drug must comply with current laws and regulations and follow the recommendations laid out in Health Canada’s guidance documents3.
• Certified Product Information Document - Chemical Entities (CPID-CE) must accompany the original submission of an ANDS, which will help the Review Division reserve, plan, and allocate the necessary resources3.
• A bioequivalence study between the generic drug and CRP must be conducted per Health Canada’s recommendations.
• Foreign sourced reference products could be used instead of CRP if the following conditions are met4.
o The foreign-sourced reference product is approved by a comparable regulatory authority (US, EU, Japan, Australia, Switzerland).
o The same innovator company markets foreign-sourced reference products.
o Comparative in vitro studies between CRP and foreign-sourced reference products are submitted.
o Other conditions laid down in the Health Canada guidance document are met4.
• If the generic drug is intended to be imported into Canada, then the importer in Canada should be identified well in advance. The establishment license of the importer in Canada must list the foreign manufacturing sites of drug substance and drug product.
• Non-medicinal ingredients, shape, size, and color of a generic drug, can differ from CRP as long as it is bioequivalent to the CRP.
All generic drugs must adhere to regulatory guidelines for good manufacturing practices in their manufacturing processes and facilities. Each drug batch must also undergo both pre-and post-production tests to meet its intended use5.

Conclusion
Generic drugs have a large market potential in Canada, and it is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Multinational pharmaceutical companies and small companies can expand their generic drug portfolios in the Canadian generic drug market. Marketing authorizations denied by the HPFB can be supplemented, resubmitted with new information, or have the decision reviewed. Several best practices are recommended for ANDS that will aid the approval of generic drugs:
• To ensure that the technical information meets the requirements of Health Canada, a gap analysis should be performed.
• Attestation checklists are an important part of the ANDS screening process to help sponsors ensure that their submissions are complete and include all of the necessary information.
• The quality part of the ANDS must comply with Health Canada’s recommendations. Compliance with guidance documents on recent topics e.g., nitrosamine impurities, and elemental impurities should be ensured3.
• Before submitting an ANDS application, all manufacturing facilities should be ready for inspection.
• The original ANDS must include a detailed justification, including supporting data, of why they use an alternative bioequivalence method to those recommended in the relevant product-specific guidance.
• For maximum success, ANDS submission strategies and guidance on risk mitigation plans should be tailored as per Health Canada requirements6.

1303,"Regulatory Submission of Generic Drugs in Canada – Best Practices","The development of a generic drug is very different from that of an innovative drug with a novel chemical composition. It must be sufficiently comparable to the latter to determine whether a generic drug is therapeutically equivalent to an innovator product. To be market-effective, drug companies must develop generic drugs that achieve the same level of therapeutic safety, efficacy, and functionality as branded drugs<sup>1</sup>.

The Canadian Health Authority (Health Canada<u>) </u>seeks to increase the availability of generic drugs to make them more affordable, safe, and accessible. Currently, generic drugs receive approvals 15 to 20 times more often than new drugs. Health Canada’s Health Products and Food Branch (HPFB) regulates, evaluates, and monitors the safety, efficacy, and quality therapeutic and diagnostic products available to the public. Several guidelines explain to what extent data must be provided before Health Canada approves a drug. As a result, for a generic drug to be approved and introduced on the market, a submission must be made to the HPFB. Upon a positive review by the HPFB, the generic drug is granted a Notice of Compliance (NOC) and a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A crucial component of regulatory approval of the generic drug is the Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) process<sup>2</sup>.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Abbreviated New Drugs Submission: The Pathway to Generic Drug Approval</strong></h2>
A sponsor must submit an ANDS if a generic version of a previously approved drug is deemed ‘pharmacologically equivalent’ or ‘bioequivalent’ to the Canadian Reference Product (CRP). The following criteria must be met in accordance with the FDA Regulations (FDR) to file an ANDS:
<ul>
 	<li>The generic drug is bioequivalent or pharmaceutically equivalent to the Canadian Reference Product (CRP)</li>
 	<li>The generic drug has the same medicinal ingredients, in the same amount, with the same dosage form as the CRP</li>
 	<li>The generic drug is administered by the same route as that of CRP<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
There may be differences in non-medicinal ingredients (excipients) between generic drugs and CRPs. However, the company must demonstrate that these differences do not affect the generic drug's safety, efficacy, or quality.

Although these are the main points to remember, there are also many other aspects to consider for the successful approval of an ANDS.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Generic Drug Submission in Canada: Common Pitfalls to Avoid</strong></h2>
A generic drug submission, or ANDS, goes through the same review process as a brand-name drug submission. The following points should be considered when filling out the ANDS to avoid common mistakes.
<ul>
 	<li>Suitable studies should be conducted to design and test a generic drug.</li>
 	<li>A generic drug must meet all national and international patent and data protection requirements. ANDS cannot be submitted before a patent expires or a manufacturer challenges it<sup>2</sup>.</li>
 	<li>The generic drug must comply with current laws and regulations and follow the recommendations laid out in Health Canada’s guidance documents<sup>3</sup>.</li>
 	<li>Certified Product Information Document - Chemical Entities (CPID-CE) must accompany the original submission of an ANDS, which will help the Review Division reserve, plan, and allocate the necessary resources<sup>3</sup>.</li>
 	<li>A bioequivalence study between the generic drug and CRP must be conducted per Health Canada’s recommendations.</li>
 	<li>Foreign sourced reference products could be used instead of CRP if the following conditions are met<sup>4</sup>.
<ul>
 	<li>The foreign-sourced reference product is approved by a comparable regulatory authority (US, EU, Japan, Australia, Switzerland).</li>
 	<li>The same innovator company markets foreign-sourced reference products.</li>
 	<li>Comparative in vitro studies between CRP and foreign-sourced reference products are submitted.</li>
 	<li>Other conditions laid down in the Health Canada guidance document are met<sup>4</sup>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>If the generic drug is intended to be imported into Canada, then the importer in Canada should be identified well in advance. The establishment license of the importer in Canada must list the foreign manufacturing sites of drug substance and drug product.</li>
 	<li>Non-medicinal ingredients, shape, size, and color of a generic drug, can differ from CRP as long as it is bioequivalent to the CRP.</li>
</ul>
All generic drugs must adhere to regulatory guidelines for good manufacturing practices in their manufacturing processes and facilities. Each drug batch must also undergo both pre-and post-production tests to meet its intended use<sup>5</sup>.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
Generic drugs have a large market potential in Canada, and it is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Multinational pharmaceutical companies and small companies can expand their generic drug portfolios in the Canadian generic drug market. Marketing authorizations denied by the HPFB can be supplemented, resubmitted with new information, or have the decision reviewed. Several best practices are recommended for ANDS that will aid the approval of generic drugs:
<ul>
 	<li>To ensure that the technical information meets the requirements of Health Canada, a gap analysis should be performed.</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/forms.html"">Attestation checklists</a> are an important part of the ANDS screening process to help sponsors ensure that their submissions are complete and include all of the necessary information.</li>
 	<li>The quality part of the ANDS must comply with Health Canada’s recommendations. Compliance with guidance documents on recent topics e.g., nitrosamine impurities, and elemental impurities should be ensured<sup>3</sup>.</li>
 	<li>Before submitting an ANDS application, all manufacturing facilities should be ready for inspection.</li>
 	<li>The original ANDS must include a detailed justification, including supporting data, of why they use an alternative bioequivalence method to those recommended in the relevant product-specific guidance.</li>
 	<li>For maximum success, ANDS submission strategies and guidance on risk mitigation plans should be tailored as per Health Canada requirements<sup>6</sup>.</li>
</ul>

1304,"Pharmacovigilance: Literature Monitoring Best Practices","Safe and effective use of health products is a key objective of pharmacovigilance. Information is provided about the safety of these substances to patients, healthcare providers, and the general public as soon as possible. Pharmacovigilance includes reviewing the development, management, and introduction of pharmaceuticals. It is probably the most tightly regulated part of the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmacovigilance aims to identify, detect, assess, and report any adverse drug reaction (ADR) related to pharmaceutical products. In the United States, the European Union, and other parts of the world, regulatory requirements have emerged that have grown in diversity and nuance. These requirements include systematic monitoring and review of medical literature, including comprehensive screening of medical journals for adverse drug reactions, which remain on the rise. Having a robust pharmacovigilance system is paramount for a manufacturer, and any deficiencies can have an adverse effect on patient safety.

Literature monitoring includes published articles, articles, and reviews in indexed or non-indexed journals, any content posted anywhere online, posters and conference abstracts, etc. Holders of a Marketing Authorization (MA) must monitor global and local literature throughout the duration of that authorization, regardless of the availability of the product on the market1. Regulatory reports, clinical trial reports, literature reports, license partner reports, and spontaneous reports all serve as sources of data for deeper analysis of regulatory reporting, signal detection, and aggregate reporting. The individual safety report (ICSR) is valuable for developing risk assessments. It is incumbent upon holders of marketing authorizations to stay up-to-date on potential publications (including ahead of print articles) by reviewing widely used reference databases (e.g., Medline, Embase, Excerpta Medica) every week<sup>2</sup>. Adverse events that meet the criteria for the ICSR are handled per regulatory guidelines on handling and reporting adverse events. When a relevant article has been identified, it will be further screened to determine if it meets the four essential criteria for consideration for Individual case safety report (ICSR) and adverse event reporting: 1) identified source, 2) company product, 3) patient, 4) adverse event<sup>3</sup>. Any analysis regarding the safety profile of a product should be based on scientific and medical publications. Literature searches and monitoring are primarily intended to identify single case reports of adverse effects and to track any changes in benefit-risk profiles associated with the drug, particularly when new safety signals safety concerns arise<sup>4</sup>.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Literature Monitoring: An Overview of Best Practices</strong></h2>
When the foundation is compromised, a process can result in a cascade of unintended repercussions. Therefore, an unbiased search is vital for monitoring medical literature accurately and efficiently. The growing volume of data has made it more critical to get the best results without introducing unwanted data. The literature monitoring process is usually characterized by two major challenges, which can be overcome. The first challenge is to come up with the right search strategy, and the second is to deal with duplication. Drug manufacturers must often track hundreds of drugs at once. So how can literature monitoring be accurate and valid?

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Optimal Search Strategy Design and Database Selection</strong></h2>
Regulatory authorities require marketing authorization holders to conduct medical literature surveillance at least weekly according to the GVP module VI and based on the required frequency as described by the local regulatory authorities, both for globally indexed literature databases and locally (non-indexed) literature journals<sup>5</sup>. When developing search strategies, it is important to consider ICSRs, aggregate reports, and any potential safety-related information. Therefore, it is essential to develop and progressively improve search strategies to limit the risk of overlooking relevant ADR information. Specifically, to retrieve all relevant records, query terms must be highly recallable and carefully crafted to retrieve maximum publications reporting any safety concerns about the product in question.

The database must be comprehensive and meet minimum standards to ensure that safety-critical signals are not missed. Pharmacovigilance searchers typically utilize at least two databases, usually three or more, because having access to multiple databases increases their recall-finding capabilities, ensuring more coverage.

Implement a search approach that balances the need for accuracy and precision. For example, 1) use several Boolean operators, 2) browse a thesaurus of terms, 3) perform proximity search, and 4) incorporate abbreviations to recall results. Using the most recent thesaurus update will ensure accuracy and compliance<sup>6</sup>.

As part of the local literature review, it is recommended to identify the non-indexed journals published locally and to screen those in either an online or print format depending on their availability. There are a few local regulatory agencies that recommend performing local literature searches in a few databases that are locally approved. The MAH handles any publications identified as containing information in local languages in accordance with the translation process established within the institution.

Industry best practice calls for constant review of search terms and updating them based on safety-related updates pertaining to the products. A GOLD standard data set of records is used to validate the modified search strategies. It is recommended to review your search strategy annually and make amendments as necessary<sup>7</sup>.

EMA hosts a robust system for medical literature monitoring. Thousands of records are added daily. It is generally the responsibility of marketing authorization holders to monitor medical literature and report individual cases of suspected adverse reactions into EudraVigilance and national safety databases<sup>8</sup>. They are not required to monitor or report suspected adverse reactions for active substances to EudraVigilance for substances covered by EMA's service<sup>9</sup>.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Duplicate Data Management</strong></h3>
Scientific publications and medical literature are abundant with sources and references, so it's likely that the same publication could be indexed in multiple formats across a variety of journals, which results in duplicate findings. This creates a whole series of redundant tasks and false signals regarding drug safety. It leads to erroneous evaluations and, ultimately, compliance problems. Duplicate management processes, however, can solve this issue. Even though this is the best way of dealing with articles, it comes with a few challenges. There may be limitations to duplicate identification within the tool due to the presence of special characters, or it may be the case that the same study has been published across different journals or conference abstracts, making the process cumbersome.

It is important to search multiple databases to capture multiple publications across different journals. Keeping track of previous searches will also facilitate the identification of duplicates. To identify duplicate publications, there should not be just a focus on the article title but also the author's name and, in some cases, the name of the study cited in the article.

According to Article 107(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, to avoid duplicate submissions of ICSRs, the holder of a marketing authorization must submit the ICSRs that are not already assessed or monitored by EMA through the Medical Literature Monitoring (MLM) services<sup>10</sup>.

Service providers should use a standardized and well-established deduplication system, enabling them to confirm that they are not missing relevant references or creating duplicates inadvertently.

Along with routine literature surveillance, MAH also conducts targeted literature searches, which are searches specifically designed to answer a specific research question. When conducting signal analysis, these searches are conducted to confirm or disprove the association between the adverse event and the product.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
Pharmacovigilance involves a substantial amount of <a href=""https://clinchoice.com/solutions/medical-device-safety/literature-monitoring/"">literature monitoring</a>. The process of devising a solid search strategy could be challenging but is essential. A professional with the required skills, experience, and training will ensure adverse event-related safety information is never missed. It is necessary to develop and maintain search strategies, elicit ideas from different stakeholders, and develop approved and suitable strategies for the purpose at hand. It is critical to set up a thorough process to handle and manage duplicate articles. Regularly review search strategies, and ensure the documentation is robust to ensure the finest quality results. The following points can be considered to check whether the MAH's literature monitoring systems meet quality standards;
<ul>
 	<li>A drug safety expert with experience researching literature is needed.</li>
 	<li>Conduct risk assessments to ensure that the search criteria are robust and relevant to the objective of the literature search.</li>
 	<li>Conduct literature searches and evaluate the results for literature per regional requirements (Global and Local).</li>
 	<li>Monitoring and reviewing the Eudravigilance Medical Literature Monitoring (MLM) system, managed by EMA, to identify ICSRs in the literature if your product is included in the active ingredient screened by EMA.</li>
 	<li>The search string is reviewed and updated annually to optimize results.</li>
</ul>

      ""text"": ""Regulatory authorities require marketing authorization holders to conduct medical literature surveillance at least weekly according to the GVP module VI and based on the required frequency as described by the local regulatory authorities, both for globally indexed literature databases and locally (non-indexed) literature journals. When developing search strategies, it is important to consider ICSRs, aggregate reports, and any potential safety-related information. Therefore, it is essential to develop and progressively improve search strategies to limit the risk of overlooking relevant ADR information. Specifically, to retrieve all relevant records, query terms must be highly recallable and carefully crafted to retrieve maximum publications reporting any safety concerns about the product in question. The database must be comprehensive and meet minimum standards to ensure that safety-critical signals are not missed. Pharmacovigilance searchers typically utilize at least two databases, usually three or more, because having access to multiple databases increases their recall-finding capabilities, ensuring more coverage. Implement a search approach that balances the need for accuracy and precision. For example, 1) use several Boolean operators, 2) browse a thesaurus of terms, 3) perform proximity search, and 4) incorporate abbreviations to recall results. Using the most recent thesaurus update will ensure accuracy and compliance. As part of the local literature review, it is recommended to identify the non-indexed journals published locally and to screen those in either an online or print format depending on their availability. There are a few local regulatory agencies that recommend performing local literature searches in a few databases that are locally approved. The MAH handles any publications identified as containing information in local languages in accordance with the translation process established within the institution. Industry best practice calls for constant review of search terms and updating them based on safety-related updates pertaining to the products. A GOLD standard data set of records is used to validate the modified search strategies. It is recommended to review your search strategy annually and make amendments as necessary. EMA hosts a robust system for medical literature monitoring. Thousands of records are added daily. It is generally the responsibility of marketing authorization holders to monitor medical literature and report individual cases of suspected adverse reactions into EudraVigilance and national safety databases. They are not required to monitor or report suspected adverse reactions for active substances to EudraVigilance for substances covered by EMA’s service.""

1318,"Clinical Trials in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Statistical Insight","An autoimmune inflammatory disorder, Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<u>,</u> develops when the body’s immune system attacks healthy cells, resulting in inflammation. RA mainly affects the joints, usually more than one joint simultaneously. As a shock absorber for joints, RA damages the cartilage by uncontrolled inflammation. The result is deformed joints over time. Finally, the bone itself starts to erode. In the aftermath of tissue damage, patients may experience long-term pain, instability, and misalignment of their bodies. Hands, wrists, and knees are commonly affected by this disease. The condition can affect other parts of the body, such as the heart, lungs, skin, and eyes.<sup>1</sup>

As of 2021, it was estimated that 350 million people in the world have arthritis (according to the <a href=""https://globalranetwork.org/"">Global RA network</a>). Since the disease is so endemic, prevention or treatment is incredibly important, and many drugs have been developed to reduce swelling and pain. However, finding a cure for this disorder has been challenging unless the exact cause is determined and unfortunately, clinical trials for drugs designed to address RA are characterized by many challenges.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Rheumatoid Arthritis Drugs: challenges in clinical trials</strong></h2>
Several treatment options for RA can lead to different clinical outcomes. Treatment failure may be correlated with established negative predictive or predisposing factors such as genetic factors, comorbidities, extra-articular symptoms (cardiovascular disease), or pregnancy, among others. These factors plague clinical trials and that present many challenges. Every stage of clinical development must have the safety of patients as the primary focus, even if it isn’t the primary end goal. Hence, choosing the correct sample size, dosage, effectiveness, and other aspects are necessary before starting a clinical trial. Statistical challenges, for the most part, emerge at this point. Having reliable comparators, cautiously selecting study participants, and tracking long-term safety are all important aspects of testing new RA drugs effectively<sup> 2</sup>.

Every situation must be considered during the trial phases of RA. For example, it may coexist with other conditions or lead to several diseases such as cardiovascular disease. When considering the above example, RA also imposes a broader challenge due to the patient group, making sample size a significant concern. Consequently, there may be dropouts or missing information. Thus, biostatisticians face various challenges during the formulation of the model. The dry run phase could be problematic if the correct data is not entered. Because of this, biostatisticians usually devise alternative strategies. We will take a closer look at the major challenges in developing RA drugs and find out how the biostatisticians are tackling them.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Challenge vs. Solution</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Challenge 1: Multiplicity Issues during the clinical trial</strong></h3>
An overwhelming amount of trial reports usually do not address multiple testing effectively. Multiplicity involves increasing the type I error rate due to various comparisons, such as comparing subgroups, comparing treatment arms, analyzing multiple results, and analyzing the same results for different intervals of time. Clinical trials have multiple testing problems, which can increase the risk of type I and type II errors, resulting in unexpected interpretation of results. Multiplicity issues should be considered for the initial design, analysis, and interpretation.

In RA, multiplicity can occur if the primary endpoint is assessed in more than one way or during interim analyses. It is due to the association of the disorder with several predisposing factors. Consider a group of patients with RA, for example, that have diverse comorbidities; the new drug may have different effects on each patient, resulting in various outcomes <sup>3</sup>. A multiplicity problem arises when multiple hypotheses are tested. It is increasingly likely that at least one valid null hypothesis will be rejected with each new test. When multiplicity is not considered, the chances of at least one null hypothesis being wrongly rejected increase. Multiplicity is one of the reasons regulators are interested in seeing a control plan.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Solution: Adjusting Multiplicity</strong></h3>
A lot of adjustments must be made by expert biostatisticians to resolve multiplicity issues. Here are some approaches to resolve or adjust this matter of concern.
<ul>
 	<li>Multiple primary endpoints may be considered co-primary endpoints. Co-primary endpoints can be various monitoring measures targeted at different aspects of a disease, strengthening the evidence for treatment effectiveness. As a result, the trial will only be successful if all primary endpoints are tested successfully (every null hypothesis is rejected).</li>
 	<li>Hochberg adjustments with ‘n’ hypotheses is another approach. It requires that the worst performing hypothesis pass. Obtaining success for one test will achieve success for all the others that haven’t been evaluated yet. A more challenging threshold would be applied to the next badly performing hypothesis when a test fails. It’s important to adjust the threshold because it helps to prevent false rejections due to small p-values (less than 5%) occurring by chance <sup>4</sup>.</li>
 	<li>Like the test outlined above, a Holm adjustment approach aims to make passing the most highly performing test challenging. It is followed by a gradual easing of the level of difficulty. One test that fails indicates that all subsequent tests that are not yet assessed have failed as well.</li>
 	<li>Bonferroni correction: This test is specifically designed to evaluate multiple comparators. The main objective is to decrease the error rate in each comparison since it may impact the other results, causing multiple false positives. Bonferroni’s adjustment involves dividing the number of tests by the alpha value (Type-I error) <sup>4</sup>.</li>
</ul>
Among these, we recommend the fixed sequence testing (Using a pre-specified sequence of hypotheses) and the Bonferroni correction model, in which the P value is well-adjusted, as one of the most effective approaches to resolve multiplicity problems.

But now that we have tackled the multiplicity issue, we are faced with a major concern: missing information/data. In trials, a large amount of data is collected (especially considering various factors), and it is possible to be lost or missed. How can this be prevented?

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Challenge 2: Missing Information/data</strong></h3>
It is common practice to monitor and evaluate a lot of data in RA trials, whether in patient records or published literature. There is always the risk of missing data in clinical research. Nevertheless, they have the potential to diminish the validity of the results. Until recently, statistical methods for dealing with missing data weren’t widely available. When missing data is present, the analysis is usually limited to only complete cases - those with no missing data in any of the variables included in the analysis. These analyses often produce biased results. Moreover, missing data associated with multiple variables often results in a large percentage of the original sample being excluded. It, in turn, reduces the sensitivity and specificity of the analysis.

The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E9 guidelines state that missing data should be prevented at any cost. It is acknowledged that there is no one solution for rectifying missing data because every design and measurement is different. A sensitivity analysis is suggested, and missing data handling will be defined in the protocol, as well as reasons for revocation. Data can be missing randomly (completely or not) or not random at all. As far as new approaches are concerned, several can be implemented statistically.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Solution: Handling Missing Data</strong></h3>
In order to handle missing data, several approaches are available. Here are some examples <sup>5</sup>:
<ul>
 	<li>Last observation carried forward (LOCF): After those who have opted out of follow-up investigations, LOCF carries forward their last observation to their last time point. If this approach is used, the carried-forward values can be treated as the observed values for the rest of the observation period.</li>
 	<li>Baseline observation carried forward: It is generally used in trials where the endpoint will return to its baseline value after withdrawal, such as chronic pain in RA trials.</li>
 	<li>Mixed models repeated measures (MMRM): MMRM is preferred for longitudinal continuous outcomes in individually randomized trials. In addition to avoiding model ambiguity, this model is unbiased for missing data absent at random or completely absent at random <sup>6</sup>.</li>
 	<li>Multiple Imputation (MI): Managing missing data using MI is a well-used approach. MI entails calculating multiple probable values and filling in the missing data for each subject with missing data related to a given variable. In turn, multiple completed sets of data are created. It enables the user to properly account for the ambiguity about the true value of imputed variables. Binary variables are imputed using logistic regression models, and continuous variables are imputed using linear regression models <sup>7</sup>.</li>
</ul>
When missing data is present, these are typically the approaches used. <strong>As a best practice, we recommend multiple imputations in such cases of missing data.</strong> Depending on the kind of data that is missing and the level of complexity of the problem, the model can be tailored to meet the needs of the project.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Challenge 3: High Failure Rate/Failing to meet expectations</strong></h3>
Innovation in RA pharmaceuticals is becoming increasingly challenging and expensive. The recruitment target and timeline of clinical trials often do not adhere to expectations. Time, workforce, funding, and patient pool resources are vital in randomized controlled trials. Despite the availability of these resources, it is important to remember that they are not always plentiful.

The price of successfully bringing a breakthrough drug to market is high due to late-stage drug failures and the rising costs of confirmatory or follow-up trials. In traditional clinical trials, predefined elements are used to design the study. Several shortcomings of randomized clinical trials have been noted in addressing factors and variables with rigid models. These trials’ success depends on the quality of their clinical assessments. Unfortunately, they are often inaccurate due to numerous anomalies, multiple endpoints, and missing data. As a result of excessive patient dropouts during the clinical stage, profound changes in design are necessary and mostly unavoidable <sup>8</sup>.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Solution: Adaptive Design</strong></h3>
It is a method of modifying an ongoing trial’s design or statistical procedures during its testing phase in response to variables generated by the trial in question, thus improving the trial’s flexibility. The goal of adaptive clinical trial designs is to make trials more efficient by shortening durations, reducing participant numbers, adjustment/modification of statistical hypotheses, and increasing the likelihood that the drug benefits the trial participants. Also, they effectively address issues related to trial design, for instance, patient variability and relevant treatment effects.

Predetermined changes that adaptive designs may permit statistically include:
<ul>
 	<li>Optimizing the sample size</li>
 	<li>Abstinence from various treatments or doses</li>
 	<li>Allocating patients to trial arms in a different sequence</li>
 	<li>Selecting patients with the highest likelihood of benefiting from recruitment programs</li>
 	<li>Terminating a trial early because of failure or lack of effectiveness</li>
 	<li>Early conclusions are possible to facilitate the development of new, effective drugs</li>
</ul>
To some extent, the FDA and EMEA have demonstrated leadership in implementing adaptive trial design <sup>9</sup>. It’s imperative to follow the guidelines of the FDA/EMEA while implementing an adaptive design

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects millions of people every year. RA can be effectively treated and managed by following a comprehensive dose regimen and self-management practices. The disease’s complexity presents several challenges in planning a clinical trial. A successful trial requires understanding the perspectives of all stakeholders. Consequently, overcoming these issues is imperative during a trial’s dry run. Hence, the best simulation models are used to achieve optimal results.

Experts develop strategies or design principles that combine experience and modern solutions to bring novel RA drugs to market in compliance with upcoming guidelines. With the right models, development timelines can be shortened, and transitions between phases can be seamless. Many prerequisites need to be in place to increase the likelihood of successful trials. It includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Expert biostatisticians with broad experience in statistical analysis, especially adaptive design</li>
 	<li>Staff with clinical research experience to efficiently integrate cutting-edge strategies/solutions into the research and trial timeline</li>
 	<li>A centralized infrastructure for performing a deep literature analysis and leveraging resources to the fullest</li>
 	<li>Regulatory analyst interpreting and implementing newly introduced or updated guidelines for advanced modeling</li>
</ul>

1442,"Rare Disease: An Overview of STXBP1","STXBP1 is a gene that encodes a specific protein called MUNC18-1 which is essential for synaptic transmission<sup>1</sup>. The MUNC18-1 protein is a key protein that helps organize the SNARE-complex which is responsible for mediating vesicle fusion with the cell membrane or other vesicles<sup>2</sup>. A mutation in the STXBP1 gene can result in impairment of psychomotor and neurodevelopmental capabilities<sup>1</sup>. Phenotypically, individuals with STXBP1 gene mutation and disruption of SNARE-complex formation of MUNC-18-1 protein will present with intellectual disability, movement disorders, and epilepsy<sup>3</sup>.

Severe early onset epileptic encephalopathies, such as Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, and Dravet syndrome are associated with mutations in the MUNC18-1/STXBP1<sup>5</sup>. These encephalopathies are often fatal and are categorized by severe intellectual disability and cerebral dysfunction. Most encephalopathies include incessant epileptic activity that causes decline in cognitive, sensory and/or motor function<sup>5</sup>.

STXBP1-related disorders are rare, only 750 cases of individuals diagnosed with an STXBP1 disorder are known worldwide<sup>4</sup>. The incidence of STXBP1 disorder ranges between 3.3-3.8 per 100,000 births and impacts families from various ethnic backgrounds that spans North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia<sup>4</sup>.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>STXBP1 Summit 2022</strong></h2>
ClinChoice had the pleasure of being a Champion Sponsor at the STXBP1 Summit that took place in August of this year. The STXBP1 Summit was an opportunity to learn firsthand from family members who are caregivers of this delicate patient population. The conference offered a bridge between all key stakeholders that are involved in research surrounding STXBP1. The event also provided a unique environment to connect with patients, investigators, researchers, sponsors, and families. The silos that are often found in research were non-existent and everyone was able to freely communicate. This occasion fostered a wealth of information and perspectives to be shared amongst each key stakeholder.

At ClinChoice, the experiences as a collective in the research realm have broadened our understanding of research at all levels. Areas of profound recognition include the importance of involvement from rare disease foundations, listening to parents and advocates on how to lessen the burden of participating in a clinical trial, as well as ways to improve trust and increase patient participation and retention. Having these events is important for intrapersonal and interpersonal development and cultivates a community of trust between all key stakeholders participating in research.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Current studies and research in STXBP1</strong></h2>
STXBP1 studies are still in the early stages of development. Currently there are no approved cures for this disorder. The available therapeutic strategies are centered around treating the symptoms of the disorder, mainly epilepsy<sup>5</sup>.  While some children with STXBP1-disorder seizure episodes dissipates approximately 40% of children still have epileptic episodes<sup>6</sup>.

The only FDA approved drug that is being used to determine its effects on STXBP1 disorder symptoms is known as Glycerol phenylbutyrate<sup>7</sup>. This drug is used to lower high levels of ammonia in the blood caused by urea cycle disorders<sup>7</sup>.  Although glycerol phenylbutyrate is an FDA approved drug it is not approved for STXBP1 disorder indication. Nonetheless studies have shown some reverse to the deficits caused by mutations in the MUNC18-1/STXBP1 in mice models <sup>7</sup>.

There are currently clinical trials testing glycerol phenylbutyrate in children to ascertain whether they can observe the same or similar improvements in deficits caused by STXBP1 mutation<sup>8</sup>. In addition to this drug study there are other studies coming in the pipeline which were highlighted at the SXTBP1 Summit such as natural history studies, further exploration in mice models, zebrafish models, and gene therapy research. Researchers, sponsors, and investigators are taking various approaches to furthering the science of STXBP1 that can potentially result in more treatment options and lead to a cure for this disease.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
STXBP1 is a <a href=""https://clinchoice.com/rare-diseases/"">rare disease</a> that phenotypically can present like many neurodevelopmental disorders. The treatments available are more focused on alleviating the symptoms of the disease and are highly centered around seizures. Doctors, sponsors, and researchers from around the world are working diligently to find out more about the STXBP1 disorder. The STXBP1 Summit acts as a vehicle where all stakeholders can share ideas, foster relationships, and cultivate a community of strength, knowledge, and compassion.

At ClinChoice, we are working together with these stakeholders to advance science to improve the quality of life of the individuals and families impacted by STXBP1 disorder.

Severe early onset epileptic encephalopathies, such as Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, and Dravet syndrome are associated with mutations in the MUNC18-1/STXBP15. These encephalopathies are often fatal and are categorized by severe intellectual disability and cerebral dysfunction. Most encephalopathies include incessant epileptic activity that causes decline in cognitive, sensory and/or motor function. STXBP1-related disorders are rare, only 750 cases of individuals diagnosed with an STXBP1 disorder are known worldwide. The incidence of STXBP1 disorder ranges between 3.3-3.8 per 100,000 births and impacts families from various ethnic backgrounds that spans North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia4.""

      ""text"": ""STXBP1 studies are still in the early stages of development. Currently there are no approved cures for this disorder. The available therapeutic strategies are centered around treating the symptoms of the disorder, mainly epilepsy.  While some children with STXBP1-disorder seizure episodes dissipates approximately 40% of children still have epileptic episodes. The only FDA approved drug that is being used to determine its effects on STXBP1 disorder symptoms is known as Glycerol phenylbutyrate. This drug is used to lower high levels of ammonia in the blood caused by urea cycle disorders. Although glycerol phenylbutyrate is an FDA approved drug it is not approved for STXBP1 disorder indication. Nonetheless studies have shown some reverse to the deficits caused by mutations in the MUNC18-1/STXBP1 in mice models 7. There are currently clinical trials testing glycerol phenylbutyrate in children to ascertain whether they can observe the same or similar improvements in deficits caused by STXBP1 mutation. In addition to this drug study there are other studies coming in the pipeline which were highlighted at the SXTBP1 Summit such as natural history studies, further exploration in mice models, zebrafish models, and gene therapy research. Researchers, sponsors, and investigators are taking various approaches to furthering the science of STXBP1 that can potentially result in more treatment options and lead to a cure for this disease.""

1503,"EMA and US FDA requirements for non-clinical development of radiodiagnostics","Pertaining to the radiodiagnostic agents, there are few changes in the non-clinical requirements between the EMA (European Medical Agency) (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018) <strong>[1]</strong> and US FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) (Docket Number: FDA-2017-D-5297, Document ID: FDA-2017-D-5297-0007) <strong>[2]</strong>. The requirements are not the same between them; therefore, for someone who needs to register a product through EMA and US FDA, it is necessary to know about the prerequisites.

The objective of this article is to summarize the EMA and US FDA non-clinical requirements for the registration of radiodiagnostic agents, along with comparing and comprehending the similarities and differences between them.
<h2><strong>EMA versus US FDA, non-clinical requirements for radiodiagnostics [1,2]</strong></h2>
The non-clinical requirements for registration of radiodiagnostic agents in EMA and US FDA are illustrated in <strong>Table 1. </strong>

The non-clinical phase is one of the important aspects of drug development; hence, extensive testing is required before the first human exposure. Specific to radiodiagnostics, the non-clinical development requirements are relatively lesser as compared to the non-clinical development of a drug; however, the type of non-clinical studies to be conducted should be determined on a case-by-case basis. For instance, the US FDA has discovered delayed radiation effects of radiodiagnostics as a serious risk, and such issues can be addressed through dosimetry and radiation threshold studies in animals before first human exposure. Because of the small dose (microdose), infrequent exposure (unless it is warranted), and low potential for toxicity compared to pharmaceuticals and radiotherapeutics.

In these lines, when an inventor is looking to launch an already existing radiodiagnostic product in a different geographical region (For example, for launching a USFDA-approved radiodiagnostic agent in EMA region or vice versa), based on the regulatory requirements, gap analysis needs to be performed to ascertain further steps on the submissions. Knowing the regulatory requirements (EMA and USFDA) will help us develop the checklist for the dossier preparation.

At Clinchoice, we have a dedicated team of experts who look after the different aspects of radio diagnostic submissions for approval, which includes summarizing the regulatory requirements, performing gap analysis, developing checklists and regulatory strategies, preparing of dossier, among other services.

1697,"First Time Into Medical Writing for Medical Devices: What You Need to Know","<strong><span style=""color: #004a98;"">New Intern (NI)</span>:</strong> Hello, Senior Medical Writer - today’s my first day! I’m really excited to know the skills one needs to acquire for writing related to medical devices!

<strong><span style=""color: #00bbb4;"">Senior Medical Writer (SMW)</span>:</strong> That’s great, and welcome! We’re happy to have you, and I hope I can answer any questions you might have. But I want you to remember two important things about medical writing for medical devices. As medical writers, we always need to ensure that the medical device is safe for a patient. In addition, it must perform as intended. But to get started, I’d like to ask you a question.

<strong><span style=""color: #004a98;"">NI</span>:</strong> Sure!

<strong><span style=""color: #00bbb4;"">SMW</span>:</strong> What’s the first thing you think of when you hear - <strong>Medical writing for medical devices</strong>?

<strong><span style=""color: #004a98;"">NI</span>:</strong> Hmm - I think of an operation manual that comes with devices like a blood glucose monitor, a blood pressure monitor, and a sleep apnea machine. But beyond that, I’m not sure of the specifics.

<strong><span style=""color: #00bbb4;"">SMW</span>:</strong> Well, that falls under medical writing for medical devices, but there’s much more to it! Let’s start at the ground level to ensure we’re on the same page moving forward. Before we get to medical writing for medical devices, let’s cover medical writing in general.

<strong><span style=""color: #004a98;"">NI</span>:</strong> Sounds good! So, <strong>what is medical writing?</strong>

<strong><span style=""color: #00bbb4;"">SMW</span>:</strong> <a href=""https://clinchoice.com/solutions/medical-writing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Medical writing</a> is a science and art involving the writing of scientific documents of different types for regulatory submissions, scientific/technical presentations, medical communication, medical journalism, and medical editing, among other needs for drugs, devices, combination products, biologics, and more.

Examples of documents include literature reviews, clinical protocols, clinical investigation reports, clinical evaluation plans and reports, post-marketing surveillance plans and reports, periodic safety update reports, 510(k), and premarket approval applications. The writing projects are essential either to obtain regulatory approval for the device to be marketed or to maintain the device on the market in different countries. Once a medical device is approved for use, there is a periodic update of most of these technical documents throughout the device’s lifecycle.

<strong><span style=""color: #004a98;"">NI</span>:</strong> I see. Then <strong>what are the specifics around medical writing for medical devices</strong>?

<strong><span style=""color: #00bbb4;"">SMW</span>:</strong> Medical writing for medical devices usually requires help from experienced professionals who understand the complexities of technical writing in a highly regulated environment. Medical writers need a basic understanding of clinical research, statistics to interpret clinical and non-clinical studies, challenges faced by the medical device industry, and regulations that govern the marketing of a device in a particular geographic location. A writer should be able to understand the importance of each document and the impact of wrong interpretation of any referred data on medical devices and their regulations. Besides, writers ensure their documents are grammatically correct and free of spelling and formatting errors.

<strong><span style=""color: #004a98;"">NI</span>:</strong> Interesting.<strong> What’s the industry demand like for medical writers for medical devices currently?</strong>

<strong><span style=""color: #00bbb4;"">SMW</span>:</strong> The demand for medical writing for medical devices has increased significantly in recent years due to a few key factors.

Increased scrutiny from global regulators requiring additional or more detailed regulatory documentation requires
<ul style=""list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 10px;"">
 	<li>a) Real-world evidence collection for all medical devices throughout their life cycle. It includes modern wearables, software as a medical device (SaMD), and other novel medical drug-device combination products</li>
 	<li>b) Increased accessibility and channel-specific content for medical device documentation</li>
 	<li>c) Clinical investigation for high-risk devices.</li>
</ul>
In addition, companies are expanding the range of medical devices. A few examples include combination products and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) based software as a medical device, among others.

As the demand for medical writing continues to grow steadily in the medical device market, many skilled medical writers have become available to help train aspiring individuals who would like to choose this career path and create a roadmap for their future.

<strong><span style=""color: #004a98;"">NI</span>:</strong> Wow, that’s really interesting! I’m guessing there are different, even more, specialized types of medical writing for medical devices, too?

<strong><span style=""color: #00bbb4;"">SMW</span>:</strong> Oh, sure!<strong> Medical writing involves writing different types of documents for different purposes and audiences</strong>, like:
<ul style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"">
 	<li>Medical journalism for the general public, written in simple, non-technical language.</li>
 	<li>Educational content for physicians, such as textbooks, continuing medical education programs, presentations, and e-learning tools.</li>
 	<li>Educational content for patients.</li>
 	<li>Marketing materials and literature targeted at healthcare professionals, such as manuals, brochures, and handouts.</li>
 	<li>Publication and presentation content, including journal articles, manuscripts, abstracts, and posters.</li>
 	<li>Research documentation, including the clinical trial protocol, investigator’s brochure, consent form, report, and proposal.</li>
 	<li>Regulatory documents, including instructions for use, clinical evaluation plans, clinical evaluation reports, periodic safety update reports, 510(k)s, and premarket approval</li>
</ul>
<strong><span style=""color: #004a98;"">NI</span>:</strong> So, different types of medical writing for medical devices are intended for a unique audience, from physicians, patients, the general public, and medical device manufacturers to regulators. That must mean that <strong>the language and the level of technical content must be appropriate for the respective audience</strong>.

<strong><span style=""color: #00bbb4;"">SMW</span>:</strong> That’s exactly right. For example, documents for medical professionals and regulators are typically highly technical and include scientific data with detailed explanations. In contrast, documents intended for patients and the general public are written in layman’s terms.

<strong><span style=""color: #004a98;"">NI</span>:</strong> <strong>What about regulatory documents</strong>?

<strong><span style=""color: #00bbb4;"">SMW</span>:</strong> Documents for regulatory submission must fulfill a set format and structure with content guided by specific regulations or regulatory guidance documents.

Changes in regulatory requirements and device specifications often require creating new or updated regulatory documents. <strong>These updates can be critical to ensuring patient safety and obtaining optimal results from a device</strong>.

1870,"CDISC Updates in 2023","In 2023, the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) has several updates in the works that will impact how clinical trial data is collected, analyzed, and shared. CDISC is a global, non-profit organization that develops and maintains standards for clinical research data.

One of the most significant updates for CDISC in 2023 is the implementation of the CDISC Library. This is a new platform that will serve as a central repository for CDISC standards, tools, and resources. The CDISC Library will make it easier for researchers and stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry to access and use CDISC standards, which can help to improve the efficiency and accuracy of clinical trials.

Another important update for CDISC in 2023 is the continued development of the SHARE initiative. SHARE stands for ""Standardized and Harmonized Automation-ready Research Environment"", and it is a joint effort between CDISC and the Critical Path Institute to develop a standardized data platform for clinical trials. The goal of the SHARE initiative is to improve the efficiency and consistency of clinical trials by providing a standardized platform for data collection, analysis, and sharing.

CDISC is also continuing its efforts to update its existing standards and develop new ones to keep up with advances in technology and scientific understanding. One example of this is the development of the CDASH-eSource standard, which is designed to facilitate the capture of electronic source data in clinical trials. CDASH-eSource is an extension of the CDASH standard, which provides a framework for the collection of clinical trial data.

In addition to these updates, CDISC is also continuing its efforts to promote the adoption of its standards and tools by stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry. This includes providing education and training resources, as well as collaborating with regulatory agencies to ensure that CDISC standards are recognized and accepted.

Overall, the updates for CDISC in 2023 reflect the organization's ongoing commitment to improving the efficiency and accuracy of clinical trials through the use of standardized data. By implementing new platforms like the CDISC Library, continuing to develop and update standards like CDASH-eSource, and promoting the adoption of CDISC standards and tools, CDISC is helping to drive innovation and progress in the pharmaceutical industry.

ClinChoice is a CDISC Platinum member, Registered CDISC solutions provider, and active participator in CDISC user groups and conferences. Our organization has experience with the CDISC data standards dating back to 2002. As the guidelines are evolving, we have processes in place to ensure all our Biometrics staff stay up to date. We create an internal Standards Newsletter to facilitate the communication of CDISC updates to our team. ClinChoice provides submission services for CDISC data packages that meet requirements of various regulatory agencies. This includes navigating the current divergent requirements of FDA and PMDA.

1876,"US Regulatory Updates for Pharmaceuticals in 2023","As 2023 progresses, there are several regulatory updates that pharmaceutical companies operating in the United States need to be aware of. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has several initiatives in the works that will impact how pharmaceuticals are developed, tested, and approved for use in the United States.

One of the most significant regulatory updates for pharmaceuticals in 2023 is the implementation of the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program. This program is designed to expedite the review of new cancer treatments by allowing pharmaceutical companies to submit clinical trial data in real-time, rather than waiting until the end of the trial. The goal of the program is to speed up the approval process for new cancer treatments, which can take years under the current system.

Another important regulatory update is the FDA's continued focus on patient-centric drug development. This means that the agency is looking to involve patients in the drug development process, from the design of clinical trials to the evaluation of potential side effects. The FDA believes that by involving patients in the drug development process, it can improve the safety and effectiveness of new treatments.

The FDA is also continuing its efforts to modernize its regulatory framework to keep up with advances in technology and scientific understanding. This includes the implementation of the Drug Competition Action Plan (DCAP), which is designed to increase competition in the pharmaceutical market by making it easier for generic drugs to be approved and brought to market.

In addition to these initiatives, the FDA is also continuing its efforts to address the opioid epidemic in the United States. This includes the implementation of new regulations to reduce the amount of opioids prescribed and improve access to addiction treatment. The agency is also working to improve the safety and effectiveness of opioid medications by requiring new warnings and labeling requirements.

Finally, the FDA is continuing to work on its efforts to streamline the drug approval process. This includes the use of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the drug approval process.

Overall, the regulatory landscape for pharmaceuticals in the United States is evolving rapidly, and pharmaceutical companies need to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in order to ensure compliance and successfully bring new treatments to market. By staying informed and engaged with regulatory agencies like the FDA, pharmaceutical companies can help to ensure that they are able to navigate the regulatory landscape effectively and bring new treatments to patients in a safe and timely manner.

2037,"New EU MDR compliance dates: Impact assessment and next steps","<h2><strong>MDR transition</strong></h2>
<a href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R0745"">Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR)</a> has replaced the dated Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD) to help increase overall compliance and standards for the quality and safety of medical devices marketed in the EU as well as to raise public awareness and ensure continuous monitoring of product safety and performance throughout the entire product lifetime.

MDR requirements are significantly more extensive than the MDD: while the MDD comprises 23 Articles and 12 annexes over 60 pages, the MDR has 123 articles and 17 annexes over 175 pages. Therefore, to maintain or obtain CE certification, companies must meet MDR requirements to remain in compliance and keep their product on the EU market.
<h2><strong>Extension of the transition period</strong></h2>
By June 2022, it was clear that compliance with the transitional phase, which was set for May 26<sup>th</sup>, 2024, was unlikely to occur since the market and industry faced numerous difficulties that would ultimately impact consumers. The biggest challenge was the availability and capacity of notified bodies (NB) accredited under MDR; post-Brexit, the EU no longer recognizes UK Notified bodies, eliminating their right to issue CE certificates, thus diminishing the number of Notified bodies available to help with the transition.

Other contributing factors include lack of advanced preparation and planning by manufacturers due to uncertainties surrounding NB availability, EUDAMED, lack of trained resources,  new compliance expectations imposed by MDR, e.g., additional safety and performance data, i.e., General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs), plausible reclassification of several devices into higher risk categories, among others. Hence, taking these concerns into account, on March 15<sup>th, </sup>2023, the EU enacted Regulation (EU) 2023/607, which provides a much-needed extension to the original MDR transitional provisions.

The extensions only apply to devices that have not undergone significant change in design or intended use and do not present an unacceptable risk to users and patients, and for which manufacturers have taken the necessary steps to comply. The fact that the MDR transition period has been extended is good news for manufacturers, but there isn’t really much time to relax.

&nbsp;
<h3>New MDR Compliance Timeline</h3>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-2041"" src=""https://clinchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MDR-EU-graphic-enlarged-02.png"" alt="""" width=""740"" height=""370"" />
<h2><strong>What should Manufacturers do?</strong></h2>
Manufacturers should have a valid MDD/AIMDD certificate on the MDR Date of application (May 26th, 2021) and completed the following by May 26th, 2024, to qualify for the extension:

1.  Implement a quality management system as outlined in MDR Article 10(9) and

2 . Formally lodge an application with a Notified Body for the device

Note: QMS implementation by this timeline is exempted for Class III implantable custom-made devices

The only exception to this would be if the competent authority has approved a derogation under Article 59 MDR or 54 IVDR. It is therefore imperative for continual business that manufacturers complete their due diligence, rather than assuming that their products will automatically be extended under the MDR if they comply with requirements after adoption. Failure to comply with the above timelines and regulations prevents the device qualification under this extension.
<h2><strong>ClinChoice’s support and services</strong></h2>
MDR’s scope of change will necessitate effective project management to establish that tasks are properly completed on schedule.

At ClinChoice, we provide services to expedite and simplify compliance achievement at any stage of the transition and compliance to help ensure our clients are not impacted from a business standpoint and that the transition process is seamless.

Our experts use their skills to create a transition plan and see it through to completion by implementing best practices and leading project teams at each stage. Our support includes but is not limited to – meeting the checklist of MDR, classification review, gap assessment, setting up the clinical evaluation process, technical documentation compilation, post-market vigilance system establishment, assisting companies to qualify for extension timelines by lodging a formal application, and written agreement, among others.

2073,"Informed Consent: Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators and Sponsors","In August of 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a final guidance document that serves to assist Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), Investigators and Sponsors in their roles and responsibilities related to the Informed Consent process. This document serves as a finalization to the FDA’s draft guidance issued in July 0f 2014 entitled “<em>Informed Consent Information Sheet</em>” and supersedes previously released guidance documents, including the FDA’s “<em>A Guide to Informed Consent</em>”, which was released in September of 1998.
<h2><strong>ICF Summary &amp; Background</strong></h2>
It is not uncommon to hear informed consent referred to as the “informed consent <em>process</em>”. This is because the signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) entails far more than just a signature. According to the FDA, the informed consent process begins with advertisements used to recruit subjects. For this reason, it is important that any information provided in such advertisements be consistent with the ICF document and contain only the information needed for a subject to confirm their interest and potential eligibility for the study.

After identification of a potential subject, an investigator, or someone knowledgeable about the study and able to answer questions about the research, should hold a consent discussion with the subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), about the research to be conducted. Often times, this discussion is lengthy and can take place over a number of days, weeks, clinic visits or phone calls between the investigator and the subject. It requires adequate time for the subject to interpret the information presented and make an informed decision about their participation, along with time for the subject to ask questions.

The ICF process does not end with subject signature and enrollment. In fact, the informed consent process continues throughout the length of the subject’s participation, requiring investigators to share any new or updated safety information that has come to light.
<h2><strong>Requirements and Exceptions</strong></h2>
The process of informed consent and the ICF document must meet 21 CFR 50.20 requirements and include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25. However, there are some exceptions to this requirement, including certain life-threatening situations, military operations, or public health emergencies (21 CFR 50.23) or situations involving emergency research (21 CFR 50.24). The FDA does not limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable Federal, State, or local law.
<h2><strong>ICF Recommendations</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Free of coercion and undue influence
<ul>
 	<li>Information presented to the subject must be in a clear, concise manner, which does not hold false promises of benefit. Any payment made to subjects should be approved by the IRB as non-coercive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Understandable language
<ul>
 	<li>Information provided to the subject, or their LAR, must be presented in a language understandable to the subject and at a level they can comprehend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Free of exculpatory language
<ul>
 	<li>The ICF document must be free of any language that implies the investigator, sponsor, site or its agents are not liable for negligence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>ICF Elements</strong></h2>
At a minimum, an ICF must include a description of the study, expected/potential risks and discomforts, expected/potential benefits, alternative procedures or treatments available to the patient, confidentiality principles, compensation and treatment in the event of injury, study contact information, and a statement of voluntary participation.

Additional ICF elements may be applicable depending on the research to be conducted, according to 21 CFR 50.25(b). Such elements may include a statement of unforeseeable risk, involuntary termination of subject’s participation, additional cost to subjects, consequences of a subject’s decision to withdraw, providing significant new findings to subjects, and the approximate number of subjects involved in the study.

Under 21 CFR 50.27, a short form may be used in a situation where the required elements of the ICF are presented orally, such as in a case where the subject or LAR is unable to read due to low literacy levels or visual impairment. Any information planned to be shared orally to support the use of a short form must be IRB approved.

All applicable clinical trials must, per FDA requirement, include the following statement exactly as written: <em>“A description of this clinical trial will be available on https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time.” </em>Additional explanation may be provided, if deemed necessary.

A copy of the ICF, preferably signed, should be given to the person who signed the consent form. For circumstances where the consent does not occur in-person, a wet-ink or electronic signature must be obtained and the signed ICF sent to the investigator by mail, delivered by the subject (at their next scheduled visit) or sent electronically.  The subject or LAR is also responsible for entering the date of signature on the ICF.

Certain circumstances, such as those involving no more than minimal risk, allow for the use of oral consent from a subject or their LAR, in which case no signature is required, and the consent process should be thoroughly documented in the subject’s case history and maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).
<h2><strong>IRB Responsibilities</strong></h2>
As it relates to the informed consent process, the IRB is responsible for review of all informed consent materials, including recruitment materials (e.g. advertisements) and supplemental materials (e.g. schedule of assessments) to ensure their compliance with 21 CFR 50.25. In their review, the IRB must ensure all materials are free from coercive language and undue influence (21 CFR 50.20 and 56.111(a)(4)). If the study involves vulnerable populations, the IRB must ensure adequate safeguards are in place. It is the IRB’s role to consider if subjects should be informed of any financial relationships or interests associated with the investigation. In case of conflicting financial interests, the IRB should ensure subjects are adequately protected.

The planned process for consent should be submitted by the investigator to the IRB. The investigator should clearly state who will be responsible for conducting the consent process and what procedures will be followed. The IRB is authorized to observe or have a third party observe the consent process, as deemed necessary.

Any new information about the research or changes to the study that may affect the rights or welfare of subjects must be presented to the IRB. The IRB is responsible for determining if a revised ICF is required based on the new information. If so, the amended ICF must be approved by the IRB before implementation by the investigator. The revised ICF should be marked with a clear identifier to distinguish between the different versions.

Should a study be suspended, the IRB has the authority to require that information be provided to subjects if it adds to the protection of their rights and welfare. However, the IRB, sponsor and investigator have the shared responsibility of determining what information is shared. If a study is terminated, subjects should receive as much information as possible regarding the rationale behind the termination.
<h2><strong>Investigator Responsibilities</strong></h2>
The investigator is responsible for obtaining the informed consent. They may delegate this responsibility to another individual who is qualified by education, training and experience, though the investigator is ultimately responsible for oversight of the designated individual and ensuring the informed consent was obtained in accordance with 21 CFR part 50. The individual obtaining consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to answer any questions posed by the subject or LAR.

It is the investigator’s responsibility to submit the planned process for obtaining the informed consent to the IRB for approval. Any material intended for subjects as part of the informed consent process must also be approved by the IRB. No materials, including the ICF, may be shared with potential subjects until the IRB has granted all necessary approvals. It is also the investigator’s responsibility to submit any new information revealed during the course of the study to the IRB for approval before the changes are initiated within the conduct of the research. An exception to this rule may occur when necessary to prevent immediate harm  to the subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)).

The investigator should consider including information related to financial relationships or interests within the consent form. For example, they may choose to disclose the source of funding for the study, information about a financial arrangement or interest of an institution or investigator and how it is being managed. If a potential or actual conflict of interest exists, the investigator should consider having another individual, who does not have a financial conflict of interest, be involved in the consent process or the investigator may choose to use independent monitoring for the consent process.
<h2><strong>Sponsor Responsibilities</strong></h2>
The sponsor may provide a template ICF to the investigator for use. However, the sponsor must make certain that the ICF is updated following any feedback from the FDA received on their IND or IDE application to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25. Any modifications made to the ICF after initial IRB submission must be re-submitted and re-approved before starting the trial.

If the investigator chooses to use the sponsor’s ICF template, it is the sponsor’s responsibility to ensure that any modifications made by the investigator satisfy 21 CFR 50.25 regulations. Should the local IRB return with significant modifications to the ICF, the sponsor is expected to share the changes with all investigators and their respective IRBs.

The sponsor may choose to be present during the first procedure for an IND trial, whether it be to provide support to the investigator or to record study-related information for the experimental device. In this case, the sponsor should outline these activities in the informed consent form, particularly if the activities of the sponsor personnel will directly affect the subject(s).
<h2><strong>FDA Responsibilities</strong></h2>
The FDA’s role in reviewing informed consent materials is to consider the appropriate communication of anticipated risks and discomforts to the subjects, as well as other required elements as per 21 CFR 50.25. If the FDA determines that the informed consent documents are misleading or do not adequately explain the required information to the subjects, they may require further revisions to be made before the trial can proceed.

For Investigational New Drugs (INDs) and Biologics, the FDA does not necessarily require the submission of the ICF with the IND, however they may request it if deemed necessary for the trial to proceed safely. Typically, the FDA will want to review the ICF if the investigation involves a known unusual or serious toxicity or risk to subjects, a vulnerable population, an unusual study design, if the study is a post marketing safety clinical trial required by the FD&amp;C Act section 505(o) to assess serious risk, involves asking subjects to forgo or delay known effective treatment for the disease, or if the FDA has other confidential or proprietary information not readily available to the IRB.

For Investigational Medical Devices which require an IDE, the sponsor must submit all informed consent documents to the FDA. The sponsor is required to correct any deficiencies noted by the FDA within the informed consent documents before the clinical trial can be initiated.

2087,"Project FrontRunner: Advantages in directing oncology therapy development to an earlier clinical setting","Project FrontRunner is an Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) initiative that encourages sponsors to consider when it is appropriate to develop new cancer drugs for advanced or metastatic disease in an earlier clinical setting. Currently clinical trials are designed to include patients who have run out of treatment options and are in their late stage of disease.

Giving patients access to new treatment options at an earlier stage will improve the safety assessment of investigational drugs. Patients in this setting have a good performance status in comparison to the late stage setting where there can be ongoing and residual issues due to numerous lines of therapy prior to enrolling in a clinical trial.

Focusing on treatment options at an earlier stage would allow sponsors to consider randomized controlled trials and other study designs including the adaptive design given the larger patient pool. From here, sponsors would be able to compare the existing standard of care with the new treatment options. This would include opening more treatment arms in their study protocols and lead to innovative study designs which move away from the traditional 3+3 design.

The acceptance of this project provides the opportunity for additional treatment options and the improved survival of oncology patients.
<h2><strong>Advancing oncology therapy development</strong></h2>
Project FrontRunner is an initiative that will have tremendous impact on the way cancer research is conducted while also having the potential to unfold new cancer drug development.

This project has the potential to increase the patient pool which would not only have impact on study enrollment, but also help sponsors to test the safety of their investigational product by examining in patients with better performance status over a longer period of time. In turn, this will lead to a better understanding of the safety profile. This seems to be a win-win situation for sponsors and patients as it results in faster clinical development and earlier access to innovative solutions.
<h2><strong>Key considerations during the transition process</strong></h2>
The scope of Project FrontRunner is tied to other OCE initiatives and early adopters will be the ones who benefit the most. However, it is expected that not all oncology trials will change to include patients in the early stages of their disease or in advanced metastatic settings and there will continue to be clinical trials in late settings.

The sponsors will need to make changes in the way they do their pre-clinical research to support this initiative. This means that the investigational drugs that are about to begin their First in Human studies may not be able to make that switch immediately and there will be a lag period.

As previously mentioned, this initiative will take traction as time progresses and the oncology research space will see the impact of the changes accordingly.
<h2><strong>Next steps in improving the standard of care</strong></h2>
As a result of Project FrontRunner, oncology clinical trials will move away from traditional study designs to innovative study designs in an effort to support different situations. Currently, most sponsors are trying to get academic institutions on board since these institutions have the types of patients who are needed to support enrollment on the study. With this initiative, the sponsors will need to make some adjustments in terms of expectations about site selection. This would mean sponsors not only need to look for academic sites but also community oncology practices to get the enrollment of patients in their clinical trials. As a result, this will help community practices who are investing in the clinical research infrastructure and in the training of their staff to support their site participation in clinical trials. From the sponsor’s perspective, this can lead to getting more sites on board and increasing the cost to perform the clinical study. Considering the way oncology clinical trials are evolving regarding precision medicine, emphasis on genomics, and other nuances to develop individualized treatment option for patients, it will get harder to find patients if sponsors are not receptive to the idea of having more sites on board in order to enroll the required patient types in their clinical studies. There is a give and take in this situation and the sooner this is realized the better it will be for the sponsor, the study sites, and oncology clinical research.

2095,"Custom-Made Medical Devices: Are You Complying With EU Requirements?","The world is progressing rapidly with advanced technologies and customization in almost every sector to meet human needs. In the healthcare sector, manufacturers of medical devices are actively involved in developing individualized products based on a patient’s needs. In some instances, over-the-counter/mass-produced medical devices, especially implantable devices, may not meet the specific patient’s requirements. Hence, <a href=""https://clinchoice.com/answering-questions-surrounding-custom/"">custom-made devices (CMDs)</a> are required to fulfill such individual patients’ healthcare needs.

This article summarizes current <a href=""https://clinchoice.com/solutions/medical-device-regulatory-affairs/regulatory-compliance/"">medical device regulatory requirements</a> for CMDs in the European Union (EU), and how these requirements differ from other medical devices.
<h2><strong>What are Custom-made devices?</strong></h2>
The EU Medical Device Regulations (MDR) Article 2(3) defines a ‘custom-made device’ as “any device that is specifically made following a written prescription of any person authorized by national law by virtue of that person’s professional qualifications, which gives, under that person’s responsibility, specific design characteristics, and is intended for the sole use of a particular patient exclusively to meet their individual conditions and needs.”

Simply put, CMD is a medical device designed for a specific patient to suit their anatomical and physiological needs as prescribed by a legally authorized and qualified professional who provides specific design characteristics under their responsibility. For example, dental crowns/patient-specific dental guards, and prostheses are all CMDs, as pictured below (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).
<h4 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Figure </strong><strong>1</strong><strong>: Examples of Custom-made devices</strong></h4>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-2097 size-large"" src=""https://clinchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/medical-devices-example-01-e1695909869978-1024x294.png"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""294"" />

However, not all medical devices tailored to meet an individual patient/user’s needs following an individualized written prescription by a qualified health professional are classified as CMDs.

Personalized medical devices are often misconstrued as CMDs. There are two types of personalized medical devices: adaptable medical devices (such as spectacle frames and optical glasses) and patient-matched devices (such as orthopedic plates, mandibular plates, and externally worn orthoses). Even though these devices are intended to suit an individual’s needs, they are primarily mass-produced utilizing industrial manufacturing procedures to meet specific basic requirements, which are then further tailored to meet an individual patient/user’s need.

In other words, a medical device based on standardized dimensions or designs not designed only for a particular individual and typically produced in a continuous production run or homogenous batch cannot be categorized as a CMD.
<h2><strong>How are the requirements for Custom-made devices different from other medical devices?</strong></h2>
Custom-made device manufacturers must comply with EU MDR before placing their products on the European market to ensure safety and performance to meet design standards. However, unlike other medical device manufacturers, CMD manufacturers must meet only specific regulations. <strong>Table 1</strong> provides an overview of these specific MDR requirements applicable to CMDs compared to other medical devices.
<h4 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Table </strong><strong>1</strong><strong>: Regulatory requirements of Custom-made and other medical devices</strong></h4>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2101 size-full"" src=""https://clinchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/table-1_1-e1695910924837.png"" alt="""" width=""637"" height=""856"" />

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2106 size-full"" src=""https://clinchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/table-1_2_2-e1695911069927.png"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""711"" />

<strong>Reference: </strong>MDR Regulation (EU) 2017/745: Annex XIII (completely dedicated to custom-made devices); Annex IX: Conformity assessment based on a Quality Management System and assessment of technical documentation; Annex XI: Conformity assessment based on product conformity verification
<h2><strong>Conformity Assessment Procedure for Custom-made devices</strong></h2>
As per EU MDR requirements, all medical devices should comply with relevant regulatory requirements to ensure conformity. <strong>Figure 2</strong> below describes the procedure for the conformity assessment of CMDs (such as notified body review) and compliance. The manufacturer must prepare a conformity assessment statement (as detailed in step 1, <strong>Figure 2</strong>) and keep up to date the documentation as stated in Annex XIII of MDR, including details such as manufacturing information, design, and performance of the device.

The manufacturers of CMDs need to follow instructions for use when using CE-marked parts, components, or materials. In case of change in any physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of these parts during the manufacturing of the CMDs, compliance of the finished product to the general safety and performance requirements of MDR Annex I needs to be met. Custom-made devices are classified using a similar risk-based approach that includes invasiveness, intended use, and duration of use as other medical devices. Manufacturers of CMDs must provide a classification reason to the notified body and details on why the device is classified as a CMD.
<h4 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Figure </strong><strong>2</strong><strong>: Procedure for Custom-made devices</strong></h4>
<h3><strong> <img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2108 size-full"" src=""https://clinchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/figure-2.png"" alt="""" width=""658"" height=""901"" /></strong></h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>MDR Compliance Timeline Extension</strong></h2>
Unlike MDD regulations, MDR mandates the involvement of a notified body in the conformity assessment of Class III custom-made implantable devices. As a benefit of the extension for the manufacturers, it is permissible to put Class III custom-made implantable devices into service or place them on the market until 26 May 2026 without needing certification from a notified body. However, for these devices, the manufacturer or their EU-authorized representative must submit a formal application for conformity assessment to the notified body by 26 May 2024. Moreover, a written agreement with the notified body must also be signed by 26 September 2024. All other classes of CMDs can be placed on the market after meeting all the applicable MDR requirements and drawing a statement as per Annex XIII of MDR.

Transitioning from MDD to MDR is an ongoing challenge for many manufacturers wanting to keep their existing medical devices available in the EU market. At ClinChoice, we take great pleasure in assisting you in fulfilling these regulatory requirements, including the preparation of <a href=""https://clinchoice.com/first-time-into-medical-writing-for-medical-devices-what-you-need-to-know/"">clinical evaluation reports and other regulatory reports for your medical devices</a>. We are here to support you with a team of proficient specialists to ensure you meet the MDR regulatory requirements for your CMDs and other medical devices without experiencing any hassle.
